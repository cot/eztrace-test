Bugs:
=====
* make -j 8 fails: fxt is linked while its compilation isn't over yet
* ./configure --prefix=/usr && make -j1 && make DESTDIR=/quelque/part/ install

Features
========
* add support for MPI-IO
* Add CUDA/OpenCL support ? For CUDA, CUPTI should be interesting
   (cf. http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-40 )
* event filtering: allow for filtering events. For instance:
   * don't record event foo if its depth is > n
   * don't record event foo if it's called more than x times
   * don't record any event whose depth is > n

eztrace_create_plugin:
=====================
* Need to add the "#include <stdarg.h>" automatically when a function
   take a variable number of parameters 
   (ie. void func(...) )
* add support for functions that a pointer to a function as a
   parameter (ie. void func( void (*func_name)(int*) ) )


OpenMP
======
* During a parallel section, we should modify the state of each thread
by adding the "team id" (~ parallel section identifier)
* Fix the memory leak in parallel_start()

MPI
===
* when using configuring eztrace to use OpenMPI, calling "eztrace
prog" may raise an 'undefined symbol' error if the program does not
use OpenMPI. This is because some symbols are defined in OpenMPI's
libmpi.so. When eztrace's libmpi.so is loaded, these symbols are
needed.
* improve statistics:
  * number of messages (per process / global)
  * compute average/mib/max/median size of messages (+add the standard
   deviation)
  * compute the communication matrix of processes

Misc.
====
* update the documentation. The creation of user-defined plugins
   should be well documented (at least on the web page) !

Statistics/Trace Analysis
=========================
* compute statistics per process/thread (find a generic way to do
   this)
