The EZTrace team is pleased to announce the release 0.8.

EZTrace is a tool that aims at generating automatically execution
traces from parallel applications. Without any modification in the
application, eztrace can provide precise information on the program
behavior (MPI communications, OpenMP parallel regions, etc.) These
informations are gathered in Paje or OTF trace files that can be
visualized with tools such as ViTE.

EZTrace 0.8 is avalaible under the GPL-2 licence and it can be
downloaded from the eztrace website: http://eztrace.gforge.inria.fr/

The following is an abbreviated list of changes in 0.8:

* EZTrace now relies on Opari2. Thus, OpenMP 3.0 programs can be
  analyzed
* EZTrace provides two trace flush policies: the trace is written
  to disk only at the end of the program (thus, some events may be
  lost, but there is now overhead) or when the event buffer is full
  (thus, no event lost, but there's an overhead when the trace is
   being written to disk)
* EZTrace now implements a trace synchronisation mechanism
* EZTrace can now instrument functions located inside the application
  or in a statically-linked library(it does not require to be
  dynamically linked anymore)
