The G\-T\-G library provides a low level library to generate traces in various formats (Paje, O\-T\-F). \par
 The use of the library is simple, you just need to include the \hyperlink{GTG_8h}{G\-T\-G.\-h} header and then you can use the library as you wish. \par
 Some simple examples are available in the test directory. \par
